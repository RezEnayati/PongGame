**Classic Pong Game**

Welcome to Classic Pong, a simple yet addictive game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points against their opponent. Below is a brief overview of how to play and the components of the game.

**How to Play:**
- Use the arrow keys (`Up` and `Down`) to control the right paddle.
- Use the `W` and `S` keys to control the left paddle.
- Hit the ball with your paddle to prevent it from reaching the edge of your side of the screen.
- Score points by causing the ball to pass your opponent's paddle and reach the edge of their side of the screen.
- The game ends when one player reaches the maximum score or when you close the game window.

**Components:**
- **Paddles:** Represented by vertical lines on either side of the screen. Players control the paddles to hit the ball.
- **Ball:** A small circular object that moves between the paddles. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while attempting to pass it to your opponent.
- **Scoreboard:** Displays the current score for each player on the screen.
- **Screen:** The canvas where the game is displayed.

**Controls:**
- Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down, respectively.
- Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the left paddle up and down, respectively.

**Rules:**
- The game starts with the ball positioned at the center of the screen, moving towards one of the paddles.
- Players score points when the ball passes their opponent's paddle and reaches the edge of their side of the screen.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls of the screen and off the paddles when hit.
- The game continues until one player reaches the maximum score or until you close the game window.

**Installation:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the source code files (`paddle.py`, `ball.py`, `scoreboard.py`) and save them in the same directory.
3. Run the main Python script.

**Have fun playing Classic Pong!**
